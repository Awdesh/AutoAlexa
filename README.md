# AutoAlexa
Amazon Alexa app that automates your daily tasks. 

# Gist-:
App aims to help user to notify them their different daily routine task at the specifed time of the day.

# Approach-:
Because of limitation of alexa (as of now) it's not possible to wake it up at a specific time in the day so we have to set few alarms on it. When alarm rings user ask Alexa "What's that" and it replies with the appropriate ToDo item at that time.

# Problem it solves-:
Right now a user sets multiple reminders on his phone/tablet/desktop to get reminded of various task throughout the day, to know what the reminder is they need access to the device to look at the reminder. Using Alexa's speaking capability user can just say "What's that" and Alexa will tell the complete task.
